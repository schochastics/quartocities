## Why????

![](img/hot.gif) Because webdesign peaked in the late 90s/early 2000s! ![](img/hot.gif)  
Also, I wanted to get a better understanding of some of the internals of quarto webpages. 
Then I found a [geocities theme for bootstrap 2](https://code.divshot.com/geo-bootstrap/#)
which I used as an inspiriation. Aaaaaaand that is how we ended up in this weird place.


## How?

Just clone the repo `schochastics/quartocities` and adapt at will.
